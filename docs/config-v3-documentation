# Example and explanation of a config file for task made in pisek

# !!! Config version 3 is experimental and can be changed !!!
# TODO comments indicate future changes

# Move 'config' into a task folder

# Values beginning with ! or @ are reserved and have special meaning:
# - Only ! value is !unset, which is always invalid

[limits]
# Resource limits for various programs: all of them are called KEY_LIMIT,
# where KEY is one of:
#   tool        Pisek tools
#   in_gen      Input generator
#   checker     Checker
#   judge       Judge
#   solve       Primary solution
#   sec_solve   Secondary solution usually subject to much less strict limits.
# and LIMIT is one of:
#   time_limit  Execution time limit [seconds]
#   clock_mul   Wall clock multiplier [1]
#   clock_min   Wall clock minimum [second]
#   mem_limit   Memory limit [MB]
#   process_limit   Maximum number of processes -- at the moment,
#           limits greater than 1 are interpreted as "unlimited".
#           Please keep in mind that killing of multiple processes
#           upon errors is inherently unreliable.
#
# Setting limit to 0 means unlimited
#
# clock_limit = max(time_limit * clock_mul, clock_min)
#               or 0 if time_limit = 0, therefore unlimited
#
# Defaults:
#  | key           | tool      | other     |
#  | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
#  | time_limit    | unlimited | 360s      |

# task making into a minefield

# Values are on/off: 

solution_for_each_subtask=off
# checks that a dedicated solution exists for each subtask (aside from samples) (defaults to off)
# A dedicated solution for a subtask is one that:
