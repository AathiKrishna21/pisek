# Enviroment for which is task developed
# kasiopea (default) / cms

solutions_subdir=solutions/
# Try to find solutions in this folder relative to config
# Default: .
samples_subdir=sample_tests/
# Try to find sample inputs and outputs in this folder relative to config
# Default: .
data_subdir=tests/
# Directory for automatically generated files (inputs, outputs, ...)
# Default: data/

solutions=correct partially_correct wrong
# List of names of solutions separated by whitespace
# First is example solution - correct outputs are genearated with it

[tests]

in_gen=src/gen
# Source code of generator (without suffix)

checker=check
# Program (without suffix) that validates inputs
# No value means no checking

out_check=diff
# Describes how to check outputs
#   - diff: checks that contestant output equals correct output (ignores whitespace) (deafault)
#   - judge: if there can be multiple solutions, checks with program (called 'judge')

out_judge=judge
# Only for out_check=judge
# Source code of judge (without suffix)

solution_manager=src/manager
# Only for C++ CMS tasks
# Link each solution with given program (without suffix)
# Used commonly for interactive tasks
