# Sum

Add two numbers.

- Subtask 1 (2 points): 0 <= x, y <= 1e9
- Subtask 2 (2 points): -1e9 <= x, y <= 1e9
- Subtask 3 (6 points): -1e18, <= x, y <= 1e18

Judge will give full points for correct result or
half points if solution matches absolute value: |a| + |b| = result
Therefore it is possible to get 3 points.
